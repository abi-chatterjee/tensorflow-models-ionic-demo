# TensorFlow Models Ionic Demo
This is an Ionic hybrid app project to demonstrate the capabilities of TensorFlow Javascript Machine Learning Models.

## Build
Make sure you have Node, Angular and Ionic installed globally. Then clone the project locally.

npm i
ionic serve

Once you establish that the local ionic build works, then you can run on your target iOS or Android device (you may need to add Android platform separately)
ionic cordova run ios
ionic cordova run android
